Aviation Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing aviation accident data to help a company identify the lowest-risk aircraft for their commercial and private operations. The primary objective is to provide actionable insights derived from historical accident trends, severity levels, and aircraft characteristics. These insights will support the company in reducing operational risks and making well-informed decisions when purchasing aircraft.

Data Cleaning Process
Data Collection:
The dataset was sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and is available on Kaggle: Aviation Accident Database.

Data Cleaning:

Missing values were identified and appropriately handled to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
Additional data transformations were applied where necessary to enhance consistency.
Key Findings
High-Risk Aircraft Models:
Aircraft models such as Cessna, Piper, and Beech have been associated with the highest accident rates.
This analysis provides valuable insights for improving safety measures, guiding purchasing decisions, and reducing overall operational risks for the company.
