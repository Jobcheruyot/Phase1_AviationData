# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

The main goal is to analyze and predict the risks associated with purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises, as part of my company's new diversification strategy.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The goal of this analysis is to examine the AviationData dataset to identify key factors influencing the viability of a project focused on aircraft operations. Specifically, I will assess the risks associated with airplane accidents and the survival rates following such incidents.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS

+ Investigate the relationship between engine type and the frequency of accidents.
+ Examine the correlation between the number of engines per aircraft and the recorded number of accidents.
+ Identify and analyze key factors that contribute to aircraft accidents, such as weather conditions and amateur-built aircraft.

### DATA
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent U.S. government agency dedicated to collecting data and conducting investigations to minimize accidents, has provided data dating back to 1962. This data primarily covers accidents occurring within the United States and Canada. The datasets include critical factors that could contribute to accidents, such as weather conditions, engine details, pilot information, and the phase of flight.

#### METHODS

Predictive modeling and descriptive analysis are used in this project to examine historical aviation data, identifying trends in aircraft performance, accident rates, and safety records. These methods uncover key patterns and provide insights to enhance aviation safety
